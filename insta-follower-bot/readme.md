Title: Building an Instagram Follower Bot with Python and Selenium

In this project, I developed a Python-based Instagram follower bot using Selenium WebDriver. The bot's main functionality is to locate a designated Instagram account, analyze its list of followed users, and automatically follow all the users present in that list.

Inspiration: The project was inspired by the idea that increasing the number of followers on Instagram can be achieved by strategically following users who are already following similar accounts. By identifying and following users associated with the target account, there is a higher likelihood of them reciprocating the follow, thereby enhancing the overall count of followers.
