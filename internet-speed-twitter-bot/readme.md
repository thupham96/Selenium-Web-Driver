Project: Developing an Internet Speed Twitter Bot

For this undertaking, I employed Python along with the Selenium WebDriver to retrieve the download and upload speeds from speedtest.net. These speeds were then compared to the current download and upload speeds provided by my internet service provider. Subsequently, the bot was programmed to share a tweet containing the gathered data.
