Title: Creating an Internet Speed Twitter Bot with Python and Selenium

In this project, I utilized Python and the Selenium WebDriver to build an Internet Speed Twitter Bot. The bot's primary function is to access speedtest.net and retrieve both download and upload speeds. It then compares these speeds with the speeds advertised by my internet service provider. Finally, the bot automatically shares a tweet containing the collected data.

Inspiration: The project draws inspiration from a subscriber who used a Raspberry Pi and Twitter to notify Comcast whenever their internet speed fell below the advertised level. Following this example, I developed a similar bot to monitor and publicly share any discrepancies in my internet speeds.
